From: Benjamin Barenblat <bbaren@mit.edu>
Subject: Remove Debian-irrelevant data from man page
Forwarded: not-needed

Remove references to cryptlib from the man page, as Debian builds this package
using OpenSSL.

Remove recommendation to statically link the binary, as this shouldâ€™t be a
decision the user has to make.
